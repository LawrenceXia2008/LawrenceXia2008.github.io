I am currently a second-year graduate student at the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.cas.cn/jssgk/jssjj/), supervised by [Ke Gao](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~0038308) and [Dongbo Bu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~dbu). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/bygk/zjby/xxjj.htm) with honors of the Outstanding Bachelor Thesis Award in 2020. I am focusing on computer vision, especially on video understanding and multimodality learning. I'm dedicated to developing more robust, efficient and explainable AI models, to pushing them towards practical applications in daily lifes.

To accelerate the video recognition architectures, one typically build a lightweight video key frame sampler to firstly sample a few salient frames and then evoke a recognizer on them, to reduce temporal redundancies. However, existing methods neglect the discrimination between non-salient frames and salient ones in training objectives. We introduced a novel multi-granularity supervision scheme to suppress the non-salient frames and achieved SOTA accuracy with very low GFLOPs and wall-clock time (*4x* faster than SOTA methods) on 4 video recognition benchmarks. 

## Multi-modal Video Frame Sampler for Efficient Video Recognition

A human can precisely elect the most informative frames with the aid of prior knowledge about the probable category
of the video. Inspired by this intuition, we pioneeringly cast frame sampling as a query-response task to introduce category prior knowledge from both visual and textual modalities in temporal sampling framework. Experimental results show the efficacy of our method on both and practical speed.
